It would be cool to fetch fresh data every minute or so, so the rates are always up to date. (and show when the last fetch took place).
I understand that time is of the essence especially with the crypto currencies.

You could also do the conversion on input onChange so you wouldn't have to click "convert".
In that case I should add a debounce function to maintain performance.

I could extract the drops downs into their own component to avoid duplicate code.

I could add a loading spinner for both fetching and calculating conversion.

I could finish the more advanced conversion algorithm (the one commented out) to make integration with other datasets easy.

It would also be nice to add symbols for each currency.
